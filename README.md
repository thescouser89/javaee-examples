# JavaEE-examples

This repository will contain example projects that will showcase the different
aspects of JavaEE. Right now, I plan to create simple projects, and will start
to populate them with more concepts as I learn more about JavaEE.

## JPA
The JPA example does not actually involve any JavaEE. I wanted to keep it simple
and simply learn JPA without any CDI / EJBs. The goal is to get a good grasp of
JPA 2.0.
